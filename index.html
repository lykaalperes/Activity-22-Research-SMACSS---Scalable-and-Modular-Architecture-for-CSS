                <h2>Phenomenal Woman</h2>
                <h3>by Maya Angelou</h3>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>   Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.<br>
                        I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size<br>
                        But when I start to tell them,<br>
                        They think I'm telling lies.<br>
                        I say,<br>
                        It's in the reach of my arms<br>
                        The span of my hips,<br>
                        The stride of my step,<br>
                        The curl of my lips.<br>
                        I'm a woman<br>
                        Phenomenally.<br>
                        Phenomenal woman,<br>
                        That's me.<br><br>
                
                        I walk into a room<br>
                        Just as cool as you please,<br>
                        And to a man,<br>
                        The fellows stand or<br>
                        Fall down on their knees.<br>
                        Then they swarm around me,<br>
                        A hive of honey bees.<br>
                        I say,<br>
                        It's the fire in my eyes,<br>
                        And the flash of my teeth,<br>
                        The swing in my waist,<br>
                        And the joy in my feet.<br>
                        I'm a woman<br>
                        Phenomenally.<br>
                        Phenomenal woman,<br>
                        That's me.<br><br>
                
                        Men themselves have wondered<br>
                        What they see in me.<br>
                        They try so much<br>
                        But they can't touch<br>
                        My inner mystery.<br>
                        When I try to show them<br>
                        They say they still can't see.<br>
                        I say,<br>
                        It's in the arch of my back,<br>
                        The sun of my smile,<br>
                        The ride of my breasts,<br>
                        The grace of my style.<br>
                        I'm a woman<br>
                        Phenomenally.<br>
                        Phenomenal woman,<br>
                        That's me.<br><br>
                
                        Now you understand<br>
                        Just why my head's not bowed.<br>
                        I don't shout or jump about<br>
                        Or have to talk real loud.<br>
                        When you see me passing<br>
                        It ought to make you proud.<br>
                        I say,<br>
                        It's in the click of my heels,<br>
                        The bend of my hair,<br>
                        the palm of my hand,<br>
                        The need of my care,<br>
                        'Cause I'm a woman<br>
                        Phenomenally.<br>
                        Phenomenal woman,<br>
                        That's me.

                    <p> How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br>
                        I love thee to the depth and breadth and height<br>
                        My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight<br>
                        For the ends of being and ideal grace.<br>
                        I love thee to the level of every day's<br>
                        Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.<br>
                        I love thee freely, as men strive for right.<br>
                        I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.<br>
                        I love thee with the passion put to use<br>
                        In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.<br>
                        I love thee with a love I seemed to lose<br>
                        With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,<br>
                        Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,<br>
                        I shall but love thee better after death.

                    <p> When I love<br>
                        I feel that I am the king of time<br>
                        I possess the earth and everything on it<br>
                        and ride into the sun upon my horse.<br><br>
                
                        When I love<br>
                        I become liquid light<br>
                        invisible to the eye<br>
                        and the poems in my notebooks<br>
                        become fields of mimosa and poppy.<br><br>
                
                        When I love<br>
                        the water gushes from my fingers<br>
                        grass grows on my tongue<br>
                        when I love<br>
                        I become time outside all time.<br><br>
                
                        When I love a woman<br>
                        all the trees<br>
                        run barefoot toward me…

                    <p> It was a long time ago.<br>
                        I have almost forgotten my dream.<br>
                        But it was there then,<br>
                        In front of me,<br>
                        Bright like a sun—<br>
                        My dream.<br>
                        And then the wall rose,<br>
                        Rose slowly,<br>
                        Slowly,<br>
                        Between me and my dream.<br>
                        Rose until it touched the sky—<br>
                        The wall.<br>
                        Shadow.<br>
                        I am black.<br>
                        I lie down in the shadow.<br>
                        No longer the light of my dream before me,<br>
                        Above me.<br>
                        Only the thick wall.<br>
                        Only the shadow.<br>
                        My hands!<br>
                        My dark hands!<br>
                        Break through the wall!<br>
                        Find my dream!<br>
                        Help me to shatter this darkness,<br>
                        To smash this night,<br>
                        To break this shadow<br>
                        Into a thousand lights of sun,<br>
                        Into a thousand whirling dreams<br>
                        Of sun!
